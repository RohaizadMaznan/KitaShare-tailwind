        KitaShare is a web application system which is able to contribute to
        students in their learning experiences to obtain with no limitation to
        get the learning materials for themselves while studying through Online
        Distance Learning (ODL).

          In general, learning materials would be utilized by anybody who needs
          it for their works or reference. As the circumstance is not the same
          as the most recent decade, learning materials are necessary to keep on
          learning through an online platform. Every course has its materials
          shared among students in the class while available on the online
          platform. The custom is the students typically print out the materials
          and scribble down notes as they sit in for the lessons. These notes
          are typically passed down and shared as they often contain valuable
          information which is not explicitly present on the slides. However,
          right now, take UTM, for instance, more than half of students UTM are
          not on campus. As a result, education has changed significantly, with
          the phenomenal rise in e-learning, through instruction on web
          platforms and remotely. This shows that fully online learning is the
          new method in continuing classes through web platforms. As a result,
          every student must obtain relevant learning materials through an
          online platform that can be challenging to find and download.
          Furthermore, students taking a programming course need support by
          getting suitable and understandable learning materials with a
          programming answer.

        <li className="py-3">
          Most of the students also have a difficulty to contact their seniors
          to obtain related materials such as hand notes, books and other
          printed reference. Moreover, some of them can be found online on some
          website that provided the materials but with some fees. Not everybody
          can afford the fees to get the learning materials, as the fees might
          be too pricey and overpriced.

          The technology keeps moving forward and changing web application
          trends the most widely used platform around the world because of
          usable in multi-platform. The web application can be viewed using a
          web browser from desktop and smartphone, which is easy and compatible
          on any smartphone devices. Hence, it is good to develop a web
          application that can deliver the maximum usability to the user by
          using the web application.
