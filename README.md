## KitaShare Web Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
KitaShare is a web application system which is able to contribute to students in their learning experiences to obtain with no limitation to get the learning materials for themselves while studying through Online Distance Learning (ODL).

### Main Features

In the project directory, you can discover:

#### Optical Character Recognition (OCR)

Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is that the electronic or mechanical conversion of pictures of written, written or written text into machine-encoded text, whether or not from a scanned document, a photograph of a document, a scene-photo (e.g., text on signs and billboards during a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on a picture (e.g., from a tv broadcast). 

#### Chatbot

The chatbot is one of two main features in the KitaShare system, where the chatbot will help the user to navigate to the correct location in the system efficiently. This chatbot was using a reply and triggered concept. When the chatbot asks a question to the user, the user will have to respond to the chatbot to understand the user's needs. This may choose an option question or direct question that needs the user to type it out by using a keyboard or keypad.
